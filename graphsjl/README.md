# Graphs.jl

This directory contains everything I am testing for the library Graphs.jl. I also try to document here a lot about the language Julia, what I encounter on my way. Therefore, this is more or less a quick reference for myself.

## Unit Testing in Julia

Since unit testing is essential for any reliable software package, and especially in one heavily implementing algorithms, we follow a strict test-driven development strategy ("test firsts!").
