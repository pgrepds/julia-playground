Looking at the date strings in the data, they have a number for the day, then space, then an abbreviation for the month, then a space, then a number for the year. The appropriate format string is therefore `\"d u y\"`. These formats have limitations: `d` accepts one- and two-digit days an `y` accepts two- and four-digit years, but `u` accepts only three-letter abbreviations. Unfortunately, data where the month names otherwise abbreviated are fairly common and they will need a different format string. "
