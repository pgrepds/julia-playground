Quite often, if we use `&` where intend `&&`, we will get an error message BUT it can also happen that a useful result appears despite the wrong operator. \n",

    "We should note that Julia goes one step further than simply interpreting \"&&\" and \"||\" logically, for the sake of efficient computation, by adopting what is called short-circuit evaluation of logical expressions. This takes advantage of the fact that an expression starting with \"false &&\" can never be true, and likewise starting with \"true ||\" an expression can never be false. Whenever such a situation is reached in a Julia computation, evaluation of the expression is stopped. That is, suppose we reach the code snippet \"true  || p1(x) \", then the function call p1(x) in the second half is never evaluated, because the expression is necessarily true. An example is \"true || sin(1.0)\", which returns the value \"true\". No free lunch: the efficiency gain comes at the price of making what appears to be a simple logical expression into a control structure. If we modify the code above to read \"true && p1(x)\" then the function p1(x) is executed, and (in Julia but not in all languages using short-circuit evaluation) its value is returned. For example, the code snippets \"false || sin(1.0)\" and \"true && sin(1.0)\" both return 0.8414709848078965, because in both cases because there is no short-circuit evaluation possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the event of returning a value generated by a function applies only to the very last item in a chain of logical operators, for example, \"p1(x)\" is the value returned by the the snippet  \" ... || p1(x)\",  where the dots stand for a long chain of operators which could not be short-circuited and which up to that point evaluated to \"false\" (similarly for \"... && p1(x)\" where the chain represented by the dots evaluates to \"true\"). This works perfectly also when \"p1(x)\" returns a truth value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that short-circuit is so powerful that the precedence noted in the manual, namely the fact that \"&&\" is followed by \"||\", is not particularly important---the vast majority of cases are settled by short-circuit evaluation."

    "## Functions in Julia\n",
    "\n",
    "A function receives some input and makes something happen. Many functions generate a value. In fact, possibly the most common use of functions is to create values to be assigned to variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia is a functional language, which means that in a sense the basic unit of organising code in Julia is the function. For instance, `typeof()` is a function that provides information which in other types of languages is obtained via other means. If we read the Julia code, we will see that virtually everything there is done via functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means of course that when we write code, we should also as far as possible organise our code in functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get help in IJulia, we simply type \"?\" followed by a topic. For functions, we'll get the syntax and in other cases some brief guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full manual is available at https://docs.julialang.org/ as well as many great tutorials and learning resources at https://julialang.org/learning/\n",
    "\n",
    "### Built-in mathematical functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia has many built-in functions, and for scientific and technical computing the most important of these are mathematical. The following lists a very small part of what is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "* exp()\n",
    "* log(), this is the natural logarithm\n",
    "* log10(), this is the logarithm to base 10\n",
    "* cos(), argument must be in radians\n",
    "* sind()\n",
    "* tan()\n",
    "* acos(), the result is a value in radians\n",
    "* asin()\n",
    "* atan(x), this only returns some angles (between \\pi/2 and \\pi/2 to be exact)\n",
    "* floor()\n",
    "* ceil()\n",
    "* rem()\n",
    "* round()"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Multiple dispatch\n",
    "\n",
    "This is related to the fact that many functions allow, or even require, more than one input value. For example, `binomial` requires two values, and `muladd()` requires three.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, functions must accept inputs of more than one type. For instance, if we enter `cos(1)` then we are sending a value with type `Int64` to Julia's `cos()` function. And if we enter `cos(1.)` we are sending a value of type Float64. But the value created by Julia's `cos()` function in both cases is `0.5403023058681398`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which is exactly what we want, of course, BUT\n",
    "\n",
    "A function name points to a code body. When the code actually executes, it should be specialised on one type, else it will run very slowly, if at all. A function such as `cos()` actually has several such bodies, to deal with inputs of different types. These are called the methods of that function. So how do Julia functions manage to have only one name, but many methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is multiple dispatch: Julia allows many methods, as long as they differ according to input type. All the input values are used to check this, hence the name multiple dispatch. The pattern of types in the input values in a given function call is its type signature. For example, `muladd()` has 12 permissible type signatures, which we see by using the functions methods()."
