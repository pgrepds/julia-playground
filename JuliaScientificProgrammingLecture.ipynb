    "\n",
    "This combination is unique to Julia. Dynamic languages (\"write code and it runs directly\") like Python and Matlab tend to be easy to learn and the programs written in them tend to quite short. Up to now, such languages have only used fairly simple type systems, which meant the programs could not be optimised to make the best possible use of processor capacity.\n",

    "* Julia functions have multiple dispatch\n",
    "* Julia supports parallel programming, is concurrent and has a data model suitable for huge data sets\n",

    "Julia is like an interpreted language. What do we mean by that? The moment we complete a line of code, it gets executed. Python and Mathematica are interpreted languages. This is the opposite of compiled languages like C and Fortran. There, the code has to be compiled before it is run. However, Julia doesn't keep an interpreter running. Instead, it uses just-in-time compilation to compile tiny bits of code and then run them. Usually, the effect is very similar to what an interpreter would be doing. It is also possible to compile a whole program as a free-standing application and call it in Python, for example.\n",
